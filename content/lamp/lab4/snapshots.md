Lightsail makes it super simple to create snapshots of your instances with a single click. These snapshots can be used to backup and restore instances, scale instance sizes up or down, and/or to deploy a new instance. 

* Return to the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/webapp/home/" target="_blank">Lightsail console home page</a>

* Click the 3 dot menu for the ***PHP-fe-1*** instance and choose ***Manage***

    ![](../../images/instance-3-dot-menu.jpg?classes=border)

* From the horizontal menu choose ***Snapshots***

    ![](../../images/2-3-3.jpg?classes=border)

* Click ***Create snapshot***

{{% notice tip %}}
Under ***Recent snapshots*** the status will change to ***creating***, you will need to wait for the process to complete before moving forward. This can take up to 5 minutes.

* Click the 3 dot menu to the right of the newly created snapshot and select ***Create new instance***

    ![](../../images/lamp-snapshot-menu.jpg?classes=border)

* Scroll down and name the instance ***PHP-fe-2***

    ![](../../images/name-snapshot.jpg?classes=border)

* Click ***Create***

* Repeat the previous 3 steps to create a third front end instance. Name this new instance you're deploying ***PHP-fe-3***

* Test the public IP of each of the two newly created front end instances in your web browser. Notice that the hostname for that particular web front end instance is listed under your task list, and that it changes based on which instance you are visiting in your web browser
