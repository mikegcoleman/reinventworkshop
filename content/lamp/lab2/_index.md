### Deploy a monolithic LAMP app

In this lab you'll deploy a LAMP stack application into your previousy-launched Lightsail instance by copying in the application code and supplying the parameters to connect the PHP front-end and the local MySQL database. 

When finished both the Apache / PHP front-end and the MySQL database will be running on the same host.
